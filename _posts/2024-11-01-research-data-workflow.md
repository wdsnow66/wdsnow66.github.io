# The Research Data Workflow and Lifecycle

The research lifecycle refers to the process of conducting research, from the initial planning, funding, and designing of a project to publishing and disseminating the conclusions or scholarship. Although the research process varies across disciplines and research domains, it often includes validating a model or hypothesis by using information and data. This site refers to data in the broadest sense of the word, including experimental, observational, acquired, and simulated data, as well as any relevant information, artifacts, and original sources. The research lifecycle also includes publishing the data, code, and workflows to facilitate the reproducibility of the published results.

## Steps

There is an increased emphasis on managing and sharing data produced in research. Many of the research funders supporting work at the University require that research data are made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. A Researcher should carefully plan the various aspects of research data management early in the project – how to plan, create, organize, look after and share research materials, whatever form they take – and anticipate meeting funders’ expectations and good research practice. 

### Plan & Design
* Data Management Plan - anticipating the data lifecycle for the project:
* Collecting – Sources, Consent & Privacy
* Storing - Data Security
* Processing – tools, data standards, third parties
* Sharing - Data Security
* Retaining - Data Security, timelines, data sanitization
* Accountability - oversight

### Collect & Analyze
* Buying and Licensing Data, Retrieval
* Data Use Agreements Processing
* Research Data Management (datatypes, data organization, metadata, storage, security, sharing, citing, privacy)
* Data Science (analysis, coding, and organizational tasks)
* Data Cleaning and Curation
* Analytic Software Tools and workflow
* Collaborative workflows
* Data Visualization
* Database and Dataset Creation
* Text Analysis
* High Performance Computing
* Data Center Hosted Computing, Virtual and Cloud Computing

### Store & Preserve
* On premise storage, data backup
* Cloud storage
* NIST Data Destruction

### Share & Publish
* Copyright and Intellectual Property
* Data sharing and Publishing (Dropbox, GitHub, Redivis)
* Open-Access Repository
* Self-deposit Institutional Repository
* Archiving research and data
