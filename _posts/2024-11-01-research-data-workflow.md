# The Research Data Workflow and Lifecycle

Research Data Workflow and Lifecycle. The research lifecycle refers to the process of conducting research, from the initial planning, funding, and designing of a project to publishing and disseminating the conclusions or scholarship. Although the research process varies across disciplines and research domains, it often includes validating a model or hypothesis by using information and data. This site refers to data in the broadest sense of the word, including experimental, observational, acquired, and simulated data, as well as any relevant information, artifacts, and original sources. The research lifecycle also includes publishing the data, code, and workflows to facilitate the reproducibility of the published results.

* Retaining - Data Security, data sanitization
* Accountability

### Collect & Analyze
* Buying and Licensing Data, Retrieval
* Data Use Agreement Processing
* Research Data Management (datatypes, metadata, storage, security, sharing, citing, privacy)
* Data Science (analysis, coding, and organizational tasks)
* Data Cleaning and Curation
* Analytic Software Tools and workflow
* Data Visualization
* Database and Dataset Creation
* Text Analysis
* High Performance Computing
* Data Center Hosted Computing, Virtual and Cloud Computing

### Store & Preserve
* On premise storage
