# Guidelines for Researchers
Senior Investigators hold day-to-day ownership for the effective management of the research data generated within or obtained from their research, including by their research groups. Senior Investigators should ensure team knowledge and establish process. Researchers should follow best practice for the [Research Data Workflow]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-11-01-research-data-workflow %}) and take advantage of [Resources for Researchers]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-08-01-resources-for-researchers %}).   
* Researchers should start wtih a **research data plan** including procedures for the collection, storage, processing, sharing, retention or deletion of the research data. 
* Researchers should identify and utilize relevant data standards and protocols, and to document their data-related decisions in the data management plan.
* Researchers should protect confidential, personal and sensitive research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct.
* Researchers should deposit their data supporting outputs in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. 
* Researchers should preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data supporting outputs after the end of their project for as long as it has continuing value, and conform to the the minimum retention period for research data and records of the institution.
* When leaving, researchers should inform their Senior Fellow where their research data will be stored and who will have access to it after they leave.
