# CREDO Lessons Learned

This is a post describing the National Charter School Study project, implementation, and lessons learned from a decade of research data workflow and database design in CREDO at Stanford, resulting in a seminal paper on K-12 School Choice. I was deeply involved in the database design, front-end and back-end implementation, and analyst support. I became increasingly involved with research data management, data cleaning, backup, data use agreements, and ultimately data sanitizaiton. Stata was our tool of choice and it is a power-tool for data analytics. Read the [paper](https://ncss3.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}

## Lessons Learned Detail
* Desktop Stata workflow and Microsoft Access database
* Central server 
* Split database: Microsoft Access DB and SQL Server 
* Increasing relationship with Stanford central IT 
* Added other research apps ArcMap (Earth Sciences), Tableau
* Improved SFTP
* Increasing relationship with Stanford Security Office
* Improved backups in collaboration with IT
* Improved disaster resilience
* Second server in NDCCH
* Improved secure data delete EOL procedures (and EOL of old server)
* New server switch-over
* Developmental installs of other potential analytic tools e.g. Python, R
