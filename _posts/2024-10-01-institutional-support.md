# Institutional Support

The institution is committed to supporting best practice for Research Data Management based on the following Pinciples. The institutional commitment is further detailed below. To build a best in class research community, the institution suggests [Guidelines for Researchers]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-09-01-guidelines-for-researchers %}) and shares [Resources for Researchers]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2024-08-01-resources-for-researchers %}) from within the institution or the broader academic community.

## Research Data Management Principles
Research data management promotes research efficiency and the widespread use of research data. Researchers should actively manage their data in accordance with the following principles. The academic institution should support researchers’ efforts with training and resources.

### Availability
The institution and researchers alike have an interest in ensuring the availability of information relating to research activities and their results, as appropriate, to the research community and the public.
* Researchers should make data available and meaningfully accessible to the research community and the public as far as sponsors, the law, and their research requirements permit.
* Researchers should retain data for a period of time sufficient in length to comply with sponsor requirements support validation of published research results, support reuse by other Researchers, support applications for IP protection, and permit internal investigations and audits.
* Departing researchers should deposit copies of all research data generated or acquired in connection with their research.
* Researchers should protect against loss or corruption of data, including making copies or in the case of electronic data, backups.
* The institution should provide necessary training and resources to support these efforts.

### Security
The institution and researchers share an interest in securing sensitive, proprietary, and unpublished data acquired or generated through research.
* Researchers should store their data on systems with appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.
* Researchers should secure data in accordance with the risks associated with disclosure.

### Compliance
Researchers should manage data in a manner that is consistent with academic norms and professional ethics, institutional policy, and obligations to third parties. The institution should advise researchers of and support their compliance with applicable laws, including privacy laws, that regulate collection of, access to, and use, disclosure, retention, and deletion of research data.
* Researchers should not share legally protected data with collaborators or third parties outside the institution without first consulting ISO.
* If research data are stored on third-party systems (e.g., cloud storage), the Researcher should comply with University-approved vendors and minimum security practices of the University.
* To the extent possible given the requirements of the research, researchers should avoid acquiring or generating data that restrict future use and sharing.
* The institution should provide resources and training that support compliance with legal obligations.

## The Institutional Commitment and Researcher Guidelines
Considering these Principles, the institution shall:

* Engender culture of good practice in data management as key to an efficient and effective research process and as a fundamental commitment to research sponsors. 
* Facilitate Research Data Planning.
* Provide liaison with Stanford University units for DUA and OSR support.
* Advise and recommend data tools and storage solutions at Stanford or third-party.
* Support researchers with best practice guidance and help identify practice standards, schema, data structures, tools.
* Provide operational liaison with Stanford units for Research Data workflow e.g. UIT, networks, web services.
* Provide operational liaison with Stanford units for Data Governance topics e.g. data privacy, security, secure storage.
* Regularly review practices to protect the organization from adverse consequences and ensuring adherence to Privacy Policies, Data Use Agreements, Information Security, and Data Governance.  
* Maintain guidelines for domain-specific repositories, sharing and dissemination of data and code.
* Selection guidelines and process for archiving and preserving data and data discovery.
