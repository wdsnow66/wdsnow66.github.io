I'm an engineer, starting as an electronics engineer in Silicon Valley and later as a database designer and user of data quantitative analytics and graph visualization applications. I'd like to capture here what I've learned about the academic research data workflow. As a Stanford University grad, I'll relate this story back to resources at my alma mater, but your academic insitution will have similar reosources. My website [my personal website](https://stanford.edu/~wdsnow/) has more information on my other projects and contact information.
