# About the Post Writer

I'm an engineer, starting as an electronics engineer in Silicon Valley and later as a database designer and user of data quantitative analytics and graph visualization applications. I'd like to capture here what I've learned about the academic research data workflow. As a Stanford University grad, I'll relate this story back to resources at my alma mater, but your academic insitution will have similar reosources.
